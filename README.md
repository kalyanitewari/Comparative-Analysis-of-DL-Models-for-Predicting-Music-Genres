# Predicting Music Genre from Song Lyrics

## Introduction

In this notebook, we aim to classify song genres based on their lyrics. We will be using the dataset available on Kaggle: [Multilingual Lyrics for Genre Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateibejan/multilingual-lyrics-for-genre-classification?select=train.csv).

### Objective

We will:
- Select only English songs from the following genres: Rock, Jazz, HipHop, Metal, and Country.
- Preprocess the lyrics data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
- Vectorize the lyrics using two approaches: CountVectorizer and TFIDFVectorizer.
- Build three different machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Random Forest (RF).
- Compare the performance of these models using classification reports and confusion matrices.

This project will help in understanding how different vectorization techniques and machine learning algorithms perform on a text classification task.

Let's begin!
